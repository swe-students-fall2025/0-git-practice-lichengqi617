# Makefile Tutorial
1. https://makefiletutorial.com/

2. Attached is a makefile tutorial, the reason being I used this the other day to understand Makefiles better. It's pretty useful for learning how to use Makefiles for automated compilation/build of C/C++. AI probably could generate makefiles, but it's still good to be able to learn it yourself.

I found the Makefile Tutorial really helpful because it breaks down a tool that often feels intimidating into clear, practical examples. Itâ€™s especially useful for understanding how to automate compilation and builds in C/C++, and it shows why knowing the basics yourself is valuable even in an era of AI-assisted development.

I've never thought much about makefiles, so it was interesting to check out a site to learn more about them. The site goes into to detail about the syntax, versions and different alternatives which helped me a bit better to understand how it can automate compilation in C/C++.
